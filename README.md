### **Situation**

At a leading consulting firm, the finance team is facing a complex challenge: the company lacks a centralised view of the financial perfomance and financial models are created at a country level without being aggregated. This lack of clarity obscured the true financial health and performance across different services and regions, making it difficult to:

- Understand the revenue distribution and profitability by country and service line.
- Assess the financial impact of the firm's diverse service offerings.
- Identify the efficiency of cost management strategies within various components of EBITDA.
- Determine the effectiveness of current financial strategies in achieving long-term profitability and growth.
- Analyze the potential for market expansion and service optimization based on clear financial indicators.
- Evaluate the conversion of financial data into strategic business actions and decision-making.

### **Task**

As the data analyst for the consulting firm, my task was to dissect and translate the financial models coming from different country teams into a coherent, interactive Excel dashboard. The challenge was to uncover hidden patterns, provide a granular view of financial performance, and empower the finance team with actionable insights to drive revenue growth and cost efficiency.

### **Action**

I embarked on this analytical journey by synthesizing financial data sets into a comprehensive dashboard. Through meticulous data processing and the application of advanced Excel features like VLOOKUPS, INDEX, MATCH functions, Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts and slicers, I crafted interactive visualizations that revealed:

- The revenue and EBITDA trends over a ten-year span, offering a long-term perspective on the company's financial trajectory.
- A service profitability analysis that exposed the relative success of our offerings such as Accounting, Artificial Intelligence, and Marketing.
- A nuanced breakdown of EBITDA, uncovering insights into revenue, cost of goods sold (COGS), gross profit, overheads, and ultimately EBITDA itself, enabling precise cost control and profitability assessment.

**Observations & Insights:**

- **Financial downturns:** between the years 2023 and 2024 unveils that there is an anticipated sharp decline in revenue within the Marketing service line, plummeting from nearly $260,000 in 2023 to $200,000 in 2024 —> possible underlying issues such as reduced market demand, increased competition, or ineffective marketing strategies
- **The heightened COGS and overheads suggest that despite the falling revenue —>** the service line’s expenses are not being adjusted accordingly —>  a strain on gross profit margins

Given this stark forecast, the finance team is now in a position to sound the alarm and steer the company's focus toward overhauling the Marketing service's financial strategy. Corrective measures could potentially recover up to £100,000 in revenue for 2024, realigning the service line's performance with the firm's financial expectations
